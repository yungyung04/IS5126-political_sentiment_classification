senator rand paul i spoke with realdonaldtrump today. the president share my thought that the last thing we need is another ground war. he doesnt want endless war. i continue to hope for deescalation and diplomacy. the iranian can not be trusted. they shot down a civilian airliner and tried to cover it up. can we really trust a country like this to abide by nuclear disarmament treaty?,1

this is the mental state of the democrat and the left. idiot politics. ugh. it a disorder and a crime. i would welcome people getting treated for their pedo fantasy because it could potentially lower the risk of them offending. it a taboo topic and not something that someone will readily admit. it becomes a crime when the person act on those fantasy. the liberal never go into depth with what they are trying to say and it hurt their cause. woe to them.,1
republican mike garcia win democraticheld house seat in california in a boost for gop the washington post. first gop flip in california in year. let hope he can keep that seat in the general this year. garcias opponent doe get another chance in november and if he can win the general his margin will almost certainly be smaller since the dems will be more motivated to turnout in november. hopefully the republican upped their ballot harvesting game after the general. if they do they can at least narrow the inevitable percentage drop post election night.,0
how the u went from having one of the worst covid response to being a global leader in vaccination under biden. please explain what the biden administration did?? getting the vaccine made in record time wa the trump administration. they let the state decide how to administer it. they had absolutely nothing to do with it.,1

ive lost all my friend over being too right wing and im not sure how to cope. removed. friend are overrated. once i started living for my wife and kid.. friend pretty much dissolved and i am much happier and doing better for myself because of that. the best advice that i have is to get comfortable with yourself and find out who you are. you may find that you were a collection of your friend idea and now you can focus on your idea. it a good thing to have time to think.,1
if they have nothing to hide why are they hiding from u? pa gop slam dominion who skip hearing. if you wanted to take over the world using a voting software why would you name it dominion? maybe next time you take over the world be less overt about it. you could name it kindness or fairness or integrity. lol. would be legendary if trump is remembered a the one who saved the republic.,1
maxine water hillary clinton and other democrat calling for violence. i have already been told by lefty of reddit and linked to a brigadier sub and hammer in pm for a week that none of these are call to actual violence and that scalise wa shot by a conservative not a bernie bro. telling you that they live in an alternate reality,1

do not become comfortable expecting a biden win. vote. i just wanted to mention that i would seriously not take bidens likelihood of becoming president for granted. the same pattern of is repeating and no one is listening. everyone basically think of biden now a mr.president but be careful. people are getting too comfortable. if we know one thing it is that trump supporter will not change their vote. he become their last standing identity and they will hold on to him a strongly a a mother hold onto her child. vote. the problem is they always vote and we dont always vote..,0

so you think that trump is showing his nazi tendency and there stormtroopers on the street of portland. here something that need to be said for a long a i can really remember republican president reagan the left ha called them nazi. when trump wa elected you said he wa a wan na be dictator. you said he wa going to find a way to declare martial law and be president forever. some of you who say and said this were the same people who scoffed and rightfully laughed when some on the right claimed that obama would do this. so truncated. they were told to arrest her bf.. they shot blindly into the house hitting her time. listen to his call to he had no idea who it wa. all they had to do wa identify themselves.,1
hillary clinton all adult in the u.s. are now eligible for the covid vaccine. science and proscience leadership got u here and we should celebrate both. too bad so many adult are being dumbass and refusing to get it.,0
joe biden only won by vote.. if trump had that many more vote across georgia wisconsin and arizona that would give him electoral vote sending the choice of president to the house of representative where the gop will hold the majority of state delegation. we need to not rest a single minute to organize and prepare for the coming election. the gop state legislature will gerrymander the hell out redistricting and increase suppression of marginalized voter. the next gop nominee may be trump or it may be an even more dangerous authoritarian without a twitter addiction and fragile truncated. this is the reality that keep me up at night. biden won his most critical electoral vote on razor thin margin. it look like a landslide if you look at just the ev he won but when you tally the margin by which he won them it frightening how close we came to disaster. the electoral college need to be abolished.,0

trump attack omar for criticizing u how did you do where you came from?. she is a piece of shit but she is our piece of shit. she is a u citizen and ha every right to criticize our government regardless of how wrong she is. saying that she should keep her mouth shut because she is an immigrant is wrong in my opinion. edit i am a naturalized citizen a well so this is personal to me. i wouldnt want a democratic president basically telling me to shut up because i am an immigrant either.,1
trump claim coronavirus is under control contradicting reality and his own top expert. when is trump going to wake up? he is damaging not only this country reputation and endangering his own citizen life. his own expert are telling a very different expectation for this outbreak. i can not believe how horrible trump lie are. i have prayed he will have a change of heart and mind and tell the truth!,0

coronavirus is spiking disproportionately in county that voted for trump in. i have an extremely conservativeevangelical aunt who keep sharing some of this alt right stuff in facebook. for one thing she compared the situation to the nazi with a meme. and her most recent meme share is that if someone fart you smell it. regardless of if youre wearing a mask or not. which i take to mean mask dont work because they didnt filter out the smell of the fart. you can not make this stuff up haha.,0

enough! president trump should pardon gen. flynn roger stone fully manafort and virtually every other american caught up in the corrupt mueller special counsel operation. and directly appoint a special counsel to hold the obamaclintondeep state abuser accountable to the law. im republican have been my whole life but do you really feel this way? these people broke the law. im not saying the libs you described are innocent in any way but we have conviction in court of law on the people you describe. they are absolutely disgraceful maybe not flynn but he shouldnt have pleaded if he wa innocent. or are you just trying to stir the crazy up?,0
coronavirus in the u today more death than the next country combined more new case than the next country combined. one month from now the second wave is going to hit opening up everything and everyone will go about business a usual and infection will increase. sadly this all could have been prevented by not disbanding the infectious disease team and pandemic response team. obama had placed scientist in country to study and act a an early warning sign. the team in china left one month before the outbreak why because trump said iam a businessman and dont pay people to sit around.,0
