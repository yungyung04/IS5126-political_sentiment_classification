if trump win the popular vote but loses the electoral college are democrat going to say trump won since he won the popular vote like they said with hillary clinton? removed. thats the thing i dont like republicanism a majority can lose because of jerrymandering or they are just more spread out so they lose in most state,1

why doesnt biden tap bernie a vp? i think the title is pretty self explanatory. the democratic party is hopelessly fractured. nobody is excited by biden and most of u on the progressive wing wouldnt believe him if cassandra came wailing from her grave prophesying that hed be the one to make ma a reality and strike down the republican forever leading to an era of peace and prosperity. so why not unite the party and pick bernie a vp? it would do a lot more for progressive than just picking a woman because it time to. and im not truncated. he already said he would choose a woman. he cant back out now or he would surely lose to trump. also woman activist would call him out on it. that would probably ruin his entire politics career. also having a woman vp would be a great change for the nation. it not that bernie wouldnt be great it just that we need a woman for a change.,0
